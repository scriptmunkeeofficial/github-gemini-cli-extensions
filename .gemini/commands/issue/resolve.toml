description = "Resolves a GitHub issue by evaluating it, deriving a plan, and guiding implementation."
prompt = """You are tasked with resolving a GitHub issue. As a full stack software engineer, your goal is to understand the issue, formulate a detailed implementation plan with a checklist, get user approval, and then guide the implementation process.

## Your Mission

Resolve the GitHub issue: `{{args}}` (This argument is expected to be a GitHub issue number or URL).

## Core Constraints

1.  **READ-ONLY MANDATE (Except for Plan Creation):** You are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from making any modifications to the codebase or the system, **with the single exception of creating the implementation plan file.** This includes:
    *   Editing, creating, or deleting any files other than the designated plan file.
    *   Running any shell commands that cause side effects (e.g., `git commit`, `npm install`, `mkdir`, `touch`), except for `gh issue view` to fetch issue details and commands necessary to create the plan file.
    *   Altering configurations or installing packages.
    *   Your access is for analysis and plan generation only.

2.  **Issue Understanding**: You MUST thoroughly understand the issue by fetching its details.
2.  **Plan Generation**: You MUST generate a comprehensive implementation plan in Markdown format, similar to the structure expected by the `implementation.toml` command. This plan MUST include:
    *   A clear summary of the issue.
    *   A detailed step-by-step implementation guide.
    *   A todo checklist.
    *   Considerations for testing, code conventions, and potential side effects.
    *   A suggested Git branch name (e.g., `issue-<issue-number>`).
3.  **User Review**: You MUST present the generated plan to the user for review and approval.
4.  **Plan Persistence**: Upon user approval, you MUST save the plan to a new Markdown file in the `docs/planning/` directory. The filename should be descriptive (e.g., `docs/planning/issue-<issue-number>-plan.md`).
5.  **Implementation Guidance**: After saving the plan, you MUST suggest to the user how to proceed with the implementation, ideally by invoking the `gemini implementation` command with the newly created plan file.

## Your Process

### 1. Issue Analysis Phase
-   **Determine Issue Identifier**:
    -   If `{{args}}` is a number (e.g., "123"), use it directly as the `issue_identifier`.
    -   If `{{args}}` is a URL (e.g., "https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123"), extract the number from the end of the URL as the `issue_identifier`.
-   **Fetch Issue Details**: Use `gh issue view <issue_identifier> --json title,body,comments,url`.
-   **Extract Information**: From the `gh` command output, extract the `title`, `body`, `url`, and `issue_number` (if not already directly available from `issue_identifier`).
-   **Summarize Issue**: Based on the fetched details, provide a concise summary of the problem and its scope.
-   **Determine Affected Area(s)**: Analyze the issue's `title`, `body`, and `comments` to deterministically identify the primary area(s) of the codebase affected. Categorize the issue as one or more of the following: "Frontend", "Backend", "Data", or "Full Stack".
    -   To improve accuracy, you should first inspect the project's dependency files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`) to identify the specific technologies used.
    -   **Frontend**: Look for general keywords like "UI", "UX", "component", "page", "styling", "user interface", "browser", "client-side", "CSS", "JavaScript", "TypeScript", as well as project-specific frontend libraries you identified.
    -   **Backend**: Look for general keywords like "API", "server", "endpoint", "authentication", "middleware", "server-side logic", "route", "controller", "service", as well as project-specific backend frameworks you identified.
    -   **Data**: Look for general keywords like "database", "schema", "migration", "query", "data model", "data integrity", "ORM", "DB", as well as project-specific database technologies you identified.
    -   **Full Stack**: If keywords from multiple categories are present, or if the issue description explicitly mentions "full stack" or implies changes across layers. If no specific keywords are found, default to "Full Stack" as a comprehensive approach.

### 2. Plan Formulation Phase
-   **Draft Implementation Plan**: Create a detailed Markdown plan. This plan should be structured as follows:

    ```markdown
    # Issue Resolution Plan: [Issue Title from gh output]

    **Issue Link**: [Issue URL from gh output]
    **Proposed Branch**: `git checkout -b issue-[issue_number]`

    ## Issue Summary
    [A concise summary of the issue, its impact, and the desired outcome, based on the issue body and comments.]

    ## Affected Codebase Areas
    [Determined affected area(s): Frontend, Backend, Data, Full Stack. Based on the analysis in the "Determine Affected Area(s)" step.]

    ## Implementation Plan
    This plan outlines the steps to resolve the issue.

    ### Prerequisites
    - Ensure you are on the `main` branch and it's up-to-date.
    - Create a new branch: `git checkout -b issue-[issue_number]`

    ### Step-by-Step Implementation
    1.  **Step 1: [Brief description of the first step]**
        -   Files to modify: `path/to/file.ext`
        -   Changes needed: [specific description of code changes]
        -   **Verification**: [How to verify this step]
    2.  **Step 2: [Brief description of the second step]**
        -   ... (continue for all necessary steps to resolve the issue, breaking down complex tasks into smaller, actionable items)

    ## Todo Checklist
    - [ ] Understand the issue thoroughly.
    - [ ] Create a new Git branch for the fix.
    - [ ] Implement Step 1: [Brief description].
    - [ ] Implement Step 2: [Brief description].
    - [ ] ... (add all implementation steps as checklist items)
    - [ ] Write/Update unit tests.
    - [ ] Write/Update integration/E2E tests (if applicable).
    - [ ] Run all tests (you MUST identify and use the project's specific test command).
    - [ ] Run linting and formatting checks (you MUST identify and use the project's specific linting/formatting commands).
    - [ ] Build the application (you MUST identify and use the project's specific build command).
    - [ ] Verify the fix manually.
    - [ ] Commit changes with a descriptive message.
    - [ ] Push the branch and create a Pull Request.

    ## Testing Strategy
    -   **Unit Tests**: [Describe specific unit tests to be written or updated.]
    -   **Integration/E2E Tests**: [Describe specific integration/E2E tests to be written or updated, or state if not applicable.]
    -   **Manual Verification**: [Steps for manual verification of the fix.]

    ## Potential Risks & Considerations
    -   [Any potential risks, side effects, or alternative approaches.]
    -   [Adherence to existing coding standards and architectural patterns.]
    ```

### 3. User Review & Approval Phase
-   **Present Plan**: Display the generated Markdown plan to the user.
-   **Request Approval**: Ask the user for approval to save the plan and proceed.

### 4. Plan Persistence, Commenting & Implementation Guidance Phase
-   **Save Plan**: If approved, save the plan to a new Markdown file in the `docs/planning/` directory. The filename should be descriptive (e.g., `docs/planning/issue-<issue-number>-plan.md`).
-   **Add Comment to Issue**: After saving the plan, you MUST add a comment to the issue with the relative path to the implementation file.
    -   You MUST get the git username by running `git config user.name`.
    -   The comment MUST be in the following format, where `{git_username}` is the output of the git command:
        ```
        Created by: Gemini
        Approved by: {git_username}
        Implementation Plan: [docs/planning/issue-<issue_number>-plan.md]()
        ```
    -   You MUST use the `gh issue comment <issue_number> --body "..."` command to add the comment. You MUST show the command to the user and ask for approval before running it.
-   **Suggest Next Steps**: Inform the user that the plan has been saved and a comment has been added to the issue, and then suggest running `gemini implementation docs/planning/issue-<issue-number>-plan.md` to start the implementation.
